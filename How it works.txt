There is 3 main components of our project, Backend Server, Pentaho PDI, PostgreSQL, and Power BI.

1. So the jobs in pentaho first call the server to update the data
2. After updating it, the transformations begin
3. After the transformations end tha tables of dimensions and the facts are created in our database
4. After that the data is loaded into the specific tables
5. Finally Power BI fetches the data from the database and show in in the dashboard
